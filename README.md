# uFeed

## What's in
This is a challenge test for UBank. The idea of the app is very simple: it's an Atom feed aggregator. As this is simplistic in nature, the implementation follows some very intuitive patterns. It relies on clasic OOP patterns to add extensibility and also breaks down coupling between API provider and the app logic.

On the positive side, uFeed boasts with error handling and retry feature, lightweight and fast UI and intuitive controls (grid list, inner WebView and pull-to-refresh goodness). From the technical perspective, uFeed caches data locally, which reduces the traffic, especially for heavy HTML pages. 

The sad thing is XML format and unreliable structure of feeds. uFeed survives the issues, however nice and graceful features like proper HATEOS and images and Ids required few workarounds.

## Challenge info
At least two user stories implemented:
- As a user I want to pick the Sport/Source/Entries that interest me so that I can read news that I care about.
- As a user I want to minimise data usage so that I donâ€™t burn through my data quota.

Offline reading is possible, however not fully finished.
- As a user I want to be able to read content offline, or where I have bad network coverage.
It can works for previously visited pages (to try it, turn off Internet connection and try revisit loaded feeds/entries)

## Tech info
All objects and interfaces are documented enough to understand the idea. Nothing fancy is there, although I'm proud of the level of decomposition achieved. It is very easy to add new features from feeds and update/change the logic of particular blocks of the app.

In terms of third-party libs, only two is used: ButterKnife and OkHTTP. ButterKnife was chosen last minute to simply save on time and keep code neat. OkHTTP is generally a standard these days, as it provides very reliable and convenient layer for networking, both for configuration and request/response handling. It is wrapped though, so can be interchanged with something else.

## Considerations

-As icons didn't work for me, I generate tile colors for entries based on hash of title.
-User-agent given in the description was causing troubles (403 errors). It is not used now (OkHTTP manages agent internally)
-Caching is achieved through OkHTTP interfaces. I enabled disk cache for it, and internally it follow conditional get requests.
-MainActivity is a straightforward implementation without any MVP or other fancy patterns. Any of those would over-engineer this simple task. Moreover, it was suggested the UI is not the focus of the challenge.

## Things I wish I'd done
Due to the lack of time, I didn't finish certain things I wanted originally. This is a list of them, along with those needing revisiting.
-Cached entries indication
-Landscape support
-Images!
-Updated time indication
-Explicit saving for offline browsing
-XML parser kernels are very straightforward. Some alternative implementation could be beneficial if more complex parsing is required. Although, it is easy to enhance.
